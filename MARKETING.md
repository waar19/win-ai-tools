### r/Windows11

**Title:**
```
I built an open-source tool to disable ALL Windows 11 AI features (Copilot, Recall, Widgets, etc.)
```

**Body:**
```
Hey everyone! 👋

I got tired of Windows 11 constantly pushing AI features I never asked for, so I built a free, open-source tool to take back control.

**🔧 What it does:**
- Detects 11+ AI services running on your PC
- Disable/Enable them individually or all at once
- Creates backups before making changes (so you can restore anytime)
- No telemetry, no data collection - 100% local

**🤖 Services it can disable:**
- Microsoft Copilot
- Windows Recall (the creepy screenshot feature)
- Bing Search in Start Menu
- Windows Widgets with AI news
- Cortana
- Edge Copilot sidebar
- And more...

**🌍 Features:**
- Modern dark UI
- Multi-language (English, German, Spanish)
- Portable .exe - no installation needed
- Runs as admin to modify system settings

**📥 Download:**

**💻 Source code:**

Built with Python + PyQt6. Contributions welcome!

Let me know what you think or if you'd like any other AI services added! 🙏

Open-source Windows 11 tool to disable Copilot, Recall, and other AI telemetry services
```

**Body:**
```
Windows 11 has been aggressively adding AI features that many consider privacy concerns:

- **Recall** - Takes screenshots of everything you do
- **Copilot** - Cloud-based AI assistant
- **Bing integration** - Sends searches to Microsoft servers
- **Widgets** - Personalized news feed

I created a free, open-source tool to disable all of these:

🔗 **GitHub:** https://github.com/waar19/win-ai-tools

**Privacy-first approach:**
- ✅ 100% offline - no internet connection needed
- ✅ No telemetry or data collection
- ✅ Open source - audit the code yourself
- ✅ Creates backups before changes
- ✅ Modifies only Windows Registry and removes Appx packages

**How it works:**
The tool modifies Group Policy registry keys and removes Microsoft AI packages. All changes are reversible.

Available in English, German, and Spanish.

Feedback welcome!

```

Hi HN,

I built a desktop app to disable the AI features Microsoft keeps adding to Windows 11.

GitHub: https://github.com/waar19/win-ai-tools

The tool lets you:
- Detect all AI services running on your system
- Disable/enable them individually
- Create backups before making changes
- Restore original settings if needed

It works by modifying Windows Registry keys and removing Appx packages. Everything runs locally, no internet connection required.

Supports: Microsoft Copilot, Windows Recall, Bing Search, Cortana, Edge Copilot, Windows Widgets, AI Voice Typing, and more.

Built with Python + PyQt6. MIT licensed.

Would love feedback on what other services to add or improvements to make.
